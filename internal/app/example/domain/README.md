# `Domain`

It's hard to say that it's definetely layer, but anyway.
Here is a place to define your model's types and its behaviour.
Behaviour in this case are interfaces. You can find here interfaces for each layer: delivery, usecase, repository.
Following some classic architectures, I think this is place where must be any validators/sanitazers for a model (holywar moment), so, you can find them here too.
